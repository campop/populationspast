<p>The <strong>Populations Past</strong> website and the associated research projects, <strong>An Atlas of Victorian Fertility Decline</strong> and <strong>Britain&#39;s First Demographic Transition: an Integrated Geography</strong>, have been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Isaac Newton Trust (Cambridge). We would like to acknowledge the generous financial support of these bodies.</p>
<p>The project is based at the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure, in the Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, with project members also based at the University of Edinburgh and previous project members at the University of Essex.</p>
<p>The data displayed here have been produced by the &#39;Atlas of Victorian Fertility Decline&#39; project (PI: A.M. Reid) with funding from the ESRC (ES/L015463/1) and the &#39;Britain&#39;s First Demographic Transition: an Integrated Geography&#39; project (PI: A.M. Reid) with funding from the ESRC (ES/S016805/1), using an enhanced version of data from Sch&uuml;rer, K. and Higgs, E. (2014). <em>Integrated Census Microdata (I-CeM), 1851</em>-<em>1911</em>. [data collection]. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive [distributor]. SN: 7481, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7481-1" target="_blank">doi:10.5255/UKDA-SN-7481-1</a>.</p>
<p>Additional data, for some indicators, has been derived from the civil registration of birth, deaths and marriage, which was introduced in England and Wales in 1837 and in Scotland in 1855. For England and Wales we transcribed parts of the tables summarising these events by year and RSD, which were published by the Registrar General in his quarterly, annual and decennial reports of births, deaths and marriages. For Scotland we derived numbers of births and early age deaths from the database created by the <a href="https://digitisingscotland.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Digitising Scotland</a> project. Summary mortality data for both England and Wales and Scotland were taken from the <a href="https://www.mortality.org/" target="_blank">Human Mortality Database</a>.</p>
<p>Boundary data for England and Wales have been created for the project by Joe Day. Citation: Day, J.D. Registration sub-district boundaries for England and Wales 1851-1911 (2016). This dataset was created by the &#39;Atlas of Victorian Fertility Decline&#39; project (PI: A.M. Reid) with funding from the ESRC (ES/L015463/1). The Day dataset has been created using Satchell, A.E.M., Kitson, P.M.K., Newton, G.H., Shaw-Taylor, L., and Wrigley E.A., <em><a href="https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/occupations/datasets/catalogues/documentation/" target="_blank">1851 England and Wales census parishes, townships and places</a></em> (2016). The Satchell et al dataset is an enhanced version of Burton, N, Westwood J., and Carter P., <em>GIS of the ancient parishes of England and Wales, 1500-1850.</em> Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive (May 2004), SN 4828 (in the UK data archive catalogue the dataset is now credited to H.R., Southall and N. Burton but the original citation is retained in the Satchell et al. reference due to uncertainty that the current version available may not be identical to the one used by Satchell et al.). SN 4828 is a GIS version of Kain, R.J.P., and Oliver, R.R., <em>Historic parishes of England and Wales: An electronic map of boundaries before 1850 with a gazetteer and metadata</em>. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive, May, 2001. SN 4348.</p>
<p>Boundary data for Scotland have been created for the project by Max Satchell from set of continuous Registration Districts devised by Eilidh Garrett. Citation: Satchell, A.E.M, Garrett, E.M, and Sch&uuml;rer, K. Continuous Registration Districts for Scotland 1851-1901 (2021). This dataset was created by the &#39;Britain&#39;s First Demographic Transition: an integrated geography&#39; project (PI: A.M. Reid) with funding from the ESRC. The Satchell et al. dataset was created from Corinne Roughley, Scotland&#39;s Parish Populations: parish boundaries, 1755&ndash;1891 (2019), deposited at National Records of Scotland; an enhanced version of I-CeM Scotland 1891 (Sch&uuml;rer, K. and Higgs, E.
