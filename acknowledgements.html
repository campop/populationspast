<p>The data displayed here have been produced by the &#39;Atlas of Victorian Fertility Decline&#39; project (PI: A.M. Reid) with funding from the ESRC (ES/L015463/1), using an enhanced version of data from Sch&uuml;rer, K. and Higgs, E. (2014). <em>Integrated Census Microdata (I-CeM), 1851</em>?<em>1911</em>. [data collection]. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive [distributor]. SN: 7481, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7481-1" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7481-1</a>.</p>
<p>Boundary data have been created for the project by Joe Day. Citation: Day, J.D. Registration sub-district boundaries for England and Wales 1851-1911 (2016). This dataset was created by the &#39;Atlas of Victorian Fertility Decline&#39; project (PI: A.M. Reid) with funding from the ESRC (ES/L015463/1). The Day dataset has been created using Satchell, A.E.M., Kitson, P.M.K., Newton, G.H., Shaw-Taylor, L., and Wrigley E.A., <em>1851 England and Wales census parishes, townships and places</em> (2016) available at: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/occupations/datasets/catalogues/documentation/">https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/occupations/datasets/catalogues/documentation/</a>.
