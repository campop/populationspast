<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of major change in the dynamics of the British population. This was a time of transformation from a relatively 'high pressure' demographic regime characterised by medium to high birth and death rates to a 'low pressure' regime of low birth and death rates, a transformation known as the 'demographic transition'. This transition was not uniform across the England and Wales: certain places and social groups led the declines and others lagged behind. Exploring these geographical patterns can provide insights into the process of change and the influence of economic and geographical factors.</p>
<p>This website allows users to create and view custom maps of different measures of both fertility and other socio-demographic measures related to fertility every 10 years between 1851 and 1911. The additional measures include childhood mortality, marriage, migration status, occupational status and population density. Brief explanations are included of each measure, including how they are calculated and how they relate to other measures. Users can zoom in to a particular area on the map, and compare side by side maps of different times or measures. The geographic units used in the maps are Registration Sub-Districts (RSDs).</p>

<h2>Geographic units</h2>

<p>The geographical units used in these maps are Registration Sub-Districts (RSDs). These were units used for reporting both census outputs and vital statistics between 1851 and 1911. There were about 2,000 RSDs in each year, ranging in area from fewer than 30 acres to well over 100,000 acres, and in population size from a few hundred people to 150,000 persons or more. RSDs which were predominantly urban tended to be smaller and often more populous, therefore with higher population density than those in rural areas. However not all RSDs covered a uniformly urban or uniformly rural area: some RSDs covered a portion of a town and some of the surrounding area, and those in the countryside included rural settlements of varying sizes. While many RSDs covered largely the same areas in different years, there was a considerable amount of re-drawing of the boundaries over time. Therefore there is a different number of RSDs at each point in time, and there was a particularly large amount of change between 1891 and 1901, when many urban RSDs were merged into larger units.</p>
<p>Boundary data: Because there was considerable boundary change between each census, each census year uses a unique set of boundaries. The boundaries used in the online version of the map have been considerably simplified to speed up the graphic display process. If you would like to use the original, more geographically precise, boundaries, please contact Alice Reid. In the explanatory text we present figures for eight groups of RSDs (see Type of Place for an explanation).</p>

<h2>Fertility variables</h2>

<p>The easiest measure of fertility to calculate is the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) which is the number of births in a year, per 1,000 people alive in the middle of that year. The CBR in England and Wales fell dramatically over the last few decades of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, decreasing from around 35 births per 1,000 people in the 1860s and 1870s when fertility was at its maximum to 15 births per 1,000 people in the early 1930s when it reached a nadir. However the CBR is a very poor measure of child-bearing experience. In the first place it is often distorted by changes in mortality and the age-structure of the population, a particularly pertinent issue in the late nineteenth century when mortality was also in rapid decline. For example if there are fewer women in the childbearing ages, then the CBR will be lower, even if each woman is having the same number of children. The Legitimate and Illegitimate Birth Rates, also provided here, to some extent solve this problem by relating the numbers of births (legitimate and illegitimate) to the numbers of women at risk of giving birth, ie married and unmarried women in the fertile ages (age 15-49). Even these birth rates, however, tell us nothing about the way that family-building patterns changed as women aged. In particular they do not tell us whether fewer children were born because women delayed the start of their child-bearing career, began to have larger gaps between their children, or stopped having children at a younger age on average. These sorts of questions can only be answered using data which give the age of the mother at the time of the child's birth, and until now such data has not been available for this crucial period of Britain's demographic history.</p>
<p>This project use the following set of fertility measures:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Total Fertility Rate: the average number of children per woman, irrespective of marital status.</li>
	<li>Total Marital Fertility Rate: the average number of children per married woman.</li>
	<li>Legitimate Birth Rate: the number of legitimate births divided by the number of married women in the childbearing ages.</li>
	<li>Illegitimate Birth Rate: the number of illegitimate births divided by the number of unmarried women in the childbearing ages.</li>
	<li>Illegitimacy Ratio: the percentage of all births which are illegitimate.</li>

<h3 class="TMFR">Total Marital Fertility Rate (TMFR)</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The Total Marital Fertility Rate (TMFR) gives the number of children a woman would give birth to if she married at age 20 and remained married (without her husband dying) until age 49. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: There are no sources for England and Wales which record how many children women had over their lifetime in this historical period, so the TMFR is calculated by assuming that each woman successively experienced the observed birth-rates of women at each age group. The birth rates of women in each age group are called Age-Specific Marital Fertility Rates (ASMFRs) and can be calculated from the census enumerators' books by identifying children and their mothers, working out how many children were born to women of each age in the five years leading up the census, having adjusted for various factors including childhood mortality.</p>
<p>ASMFRs and TMFRs are calculated using a database of the individual level census enumerators' books for each census year originally made available by the <a href="http://icem.data-archive.ac.uk/">I-CeM project</a> and further enhanced by the Atlas of Fertility project team.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: The Total Marital Fertility Rate (TMFR) can be interpreted as the average number of children a women would have during her marriage, if she married at age 20 and stayed married until age 49. It is important to bear in mind that it was unusual to marry this young in England and Wales in the nineteenth century, therefore the TMFR should not be interpreted as the experience of a typical married women. Because the majority of women were over 25 when they got married, a more typical experience can be expressed by calculating the number of children a woman would have had if she married at age 25, and this measure, TMFR(25-49), is given in the graph below, alongside the usual measure, TMFR(20-49). This shows that women who married at age 20 had on average just over two more children than did women who married at age 25. As can be seen by the trends in the Singulate Age at Marriage (SMAM), marriage age increased in the last couple of decades of the nineteenth century, and this contributed to the decline in overall fertility as measured by the Total Fertility Rate (TFR). However the major driver of the fertility decline was a decline in marital fertility, which decreased by over one children per woman between 1881 and 1911. The fertility transition can therefore be characterised as a change from fertility control <em>by</em> marriage to fertility control <em>within </em>marriage.</p>
<p><img src="/images/about/tmfr1.png" alt="Total Marital Fertility Rate" width="476" height="328" /></p>
<p>Although much of the geographical and social differences in fertility were due to differences in the age of marriage and the propensity to never marry, there were also differences, before fertility started to decline, in fertility rates among those who were married, with high marital fertility in both mining and agricultural areas. Because changes in marital fertility happened earlier in some types of place - notably textile areas, but also professional places - and were delayed in others (mining, transport and other urban areas) the geographical differences in marital fertility increased. </p>

<h3 class="TFR">Total Fertility Rate (TFR)</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) gives the average number of children a woman gives birth to between the ages of 20 and 49. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: There are no sources which record how many children women had over their lifetime in this historical period, so the TFR is calculated by assuming that each woman successively experienced the observed birth-rates of women at each age group. The birth rates of women in each age group are called Age-Specific Fertility Rates (ASFRs) and can be calculated from the census enumerators' books by identifying children and their mothers, working out how many children were born to women of each age in the five years leading up the census, and adjusting for various factors including child mortality and children living away from their mothers.</p>
<p>ASFRs and TFRs are calculated using a database of the individual level census enumerators' books for each census year originally made available by the <a href="http://icem.data-archive.ac.uk/">I-CeM project</a> and further enhanced by the Atlas of Fertility project team.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) can be interpreted as the average number of children a woman gives birth to over her life-time. In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, women in England and Wales had around four and a half children each, although there was considerable geographic variation, with considerably higher fertility in the mining areas of the North-East, and particularly low fertility in the West End of London. By 1911 the TFR had fallen by a third, and women were having only three children each. It is important to bear in mind that many women remained unmarried and without any children at all, and this reduces the average number of children borne per woman. In fact, much of the geographical and social difference in TFR is due to different patterns of marriage (see Singulate Mean Age of Marriage, Celibacy). Although increases in the age at marriage towards the end of the nineteenth century contributed to falling fertility, the major driver of the fertility decline was a decline in marital fertility, which is given by a related measure, the Total Marital Fertility Rate (TMFR).</p>

<h3 class="LEGIT_RATE">Legitimate Birth Rate</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Legitimate Birth Rate gives the number of legitimate births in a year per 1,000 married women aged 15-49. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The Legitimate Birth Rate is calculated using the numbers of legitimate births for each RSD published in the Registrar General's Annual Reports. In most cases the number of births is averaged over the year before the census year, the census year and the year after the census year three years in order to minimise the effect of small numbers. However 1910 was the last year for which data on the number of births by legitimacy was published for RSDs, so for our 1911 figures only births for 1910 were used. In some cases where boundary changes occurred in the three years around a census, the average was calculated using births from the year where the birth and census data referred to the same RSD. The number of married women in each RSD were calculated using the individual level census data, inflating the figure by the ratio of the population in the I-CeM database to the population for the same RSD published in the census reports. This was done to minimise the impact of data missing from the ICeM dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Fertility in England and Wales did not start to fall until the late 1870s or the early 1880s. From then until the 1930s, the number of children born per 1,000 married women fell steadily. There were, however differences in birth rates between different types of place even before the fertility decline, with highest levels in mining areas and lowest levels in professional places. It is noticeable that the legitimate birth rate in textile areas was already falling between 1851 and 1861- around 30 years earlier than in other types of place.</p>

<h3 class="ILEG_RATE">Illegitimate Birth Rate </h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The Illegitimate Birth Rate gives the number of illegitimate births in a year per 1,000 single, divorced and widowed women aged 15-49. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The Illegitimate Birth Rate is calculated using the numbers of illegitimate births for each RSD published in the Registrar General's Annual Reports. In most cases the number of births is averaged over the year before the census year, the census year and the year after the census year three years in order to minimise the effect of small numbers. However 1910 was the last year for which data on the number of births by legitimacy was published for RSDs, so for our 1911 figures only births for 1910 were used. In some cases where boundary changes occurred in the three years around a census, the average was calculated using births from the year where the birth and census data referred to the same RSD. The number of single, divorced and widowed women in each RSD were calculated using the individual level census data, inflating the figure by the ratio of the population in the I-CeM database to the population for the same RSD published in the census reports. This was done to minimise the impact of data missing from the ICeM dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Illegitimacy was not uncommon in historic England and Wales: in 1851 there were nearly 20 illegitimate births for every 1,000 unmarried women. However the risks of a woman having a child out of marriage fell by over half in the Victorian era, to less than 8 illegitimate births per 1,000 unmarried women in 1911. In the British past, illegitimate fertility often varied with legitimate fertility - in other words when people married young and had many children within marriage, they were also more likely to have had children before they got married. This relationship is also evident in the nineteenth century geographic patterns of legitimate and illegitimate fertility: mining areas had high legitimate and illegitimate birth rates, whereas professional areas had low rates of both, and textile areas witnessed earlier declines in both type of fertility although illegitimate birth rates fell noticeably faster than legitimate in the early years.</p>

<h3 class="ILEG_RATIO">Illegitimacy Ratio</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The Illegitimacy Ratio gives the number of illegitimate births as a percentage of all births.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The Illegitimacy Ratio is calculated using the numbers of legitimate and illegitimate births for each RSD published in the Registrar General's Annual Reports. An average of three years of births is used to minimise the effect of small numbers: the year before the census year, the census year and the year after the census year (although the data stopped being published in this form after 1910 so for 1911 only 1910 is used). </p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Illegitimacy was not uncommon in historic England and Wales, but it underwent a sustained decline over the Victorian era, falling from around 7 per cent of all births in 1851 to around 4 per cent in 1901. As with many demographic characteristics, there were significant geographical variations in illegitimacy. In general agricultural areas had higher percentages of illegitimate births, but inspection of the maps shows that this was particularly concentrated in mid-Wales and Shropshire, Norfolk, the East Riding of Yorkshire, and the North, a phenomena which has been linked to particular agricultural systems and cultural norms. Illegitimacy ratios were particularly low in transport areas, and all areas except transport witnessed declines in this measure of illegitimacy, with particularly rapid and early declines in textile areas. Particularly high illegitimacy ratios in isolated urban areas may be connected to maternity hospitals and other institutions which catered for unmarried mothers.</p>
<p><img src="/images/about/ileg_ratio1.png" alt="Illegitimacy Ratio" width="477" height="331" /></p>
<p><img src="/images/about/ileg_ratio2.png" alt="Illegitimacy Ratio" width="587" height="369" /></p>
<p><strong>The relationship between the illegitimacy ratio and the illegitimate birth rate</strong>: The Illegitimacy ratio measures illegitimate births as a percentage of all births, and the Illegitimate birth rate measures illegitimate births per 1,000 women of childbearing age. The ratio can therefore be distorted by the changes in the number of legitimate births, and this is what is happening to the illegitimacy ratio in 1911. The number of illegitimate births was actually continuing to decline, but by this stage the number of legitimate births was declining at a similar or faster rate, so the percentage of births which were illegitimate rose. Different levels of legitimate fertility also affect the relationship between places: the illegitimacy ratio in mining areas seems moderate, but this is because both illegitimate and legitimate birth rates were high. In contrast the illegitimacy ratio in professional areas seems high - particularly towards the end of the period, but the legitimate birth rate in this type of place was low, so although the percentage of births which was illegitimate was higher than in other places by 1911, there were far more single women and the risk of any single women having an illegitimate birth was actually lower than in any other type of place. Despite its deficiencies, the Illegitimacy Ratio uses less data than the Illegitimate Birth Rate and is therefore a more widely calculated measure. </p>

<h3 class="IMR">Infant mortality rate (IMR)</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The infant mortality rate is the number of children who died before they were a year old out of each 1,000 children born. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The graph of the national IMR shows annual rates obtained from the Human Mortality Database (and ultimately from registered births and deaths), but for smaller geographic units we show IMRs calculated for the five years leading up to each census to minimise the fluctuations due to small numbers in some areas. To calculate the IMR for our small geographic units, we divide all deaths to infants (i.e. children under a year old) in the five years leading up to each census (e.g. April 1876 to March 1881 for the five years leading up to the 1881 census), by the number of children born in the same period, and multiply by 1,000. Some of the deaths to infants dying in the early part of the period (e.g. in April 1876) will have been to infants born before the start of the period (e.g. in February 1876), but this is compensated for by the deaths of children born towards the end of the period e.g. in March 1881) who died after the census (e.g. in May 1881). This is the usual method for calculating the infant mortality rate. The data on infant births and deaths were obtained from the Registrar General's Quarterly Returns of Births, Deaths and Marriages. </p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: The IMR was around 150 per thousand for England and Wales as a whole across the second half of the nineteenth century. Rates were slightly lower in the 1880s, but suffered a resurgence in the 1890s when a series of long, hot summers caused spikes in infant diarrhoeal deaths, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, unlike mortality at older ages of childhood and in adulthood which began to decline from about 1870, the national infant mortality rate did not start to decline until the turn of the century. 1911 also saw a particularly hot summer which increased IMR, and this shows up in the national rates (which are for complete calendar years) but not in our local rates where we only calculate mortality up to the date of the census which was taken on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of April, 1911.</p>
<p><img src="/images/about/imr1.png" alt="Infant mortality rate" width="494" height="323" /></p>
<p>There was considerable geographic variation in rates of infant mortality across England and Wales, with rates below 100 per 1000 in many agricultural areas and over 200 per thousand in some urban industrial places over the last half of the nineteenth century. Higher urban infant mortality has been attributed to crowded populations living in crowded and insanitary conditions, favouring the spread of infectious diseases. 'Transport' places had the highest infant mortality at the beginning of the period, with other industrial areas, including textile places, also having high rates of infant death (see also Population Density). After agricultural areas, where a benign disease environment and low chance of spreading infections kept the risks of infant death low, mortality was lowest in professional areas where accommodation was well spaced out, facilities were good and housing was often located away from industrial and natural hazards. </p>
<p>The infant mortality rates by type of place show that the resurgence of increases in infant mortality in the 1890s was concentrated in transport, mining and other urban places, and that the decline from the turn of the century was less pronounced in mining and other urban areas and very small in agricultural areas where mortality was already low.</p>

<h3 class="ECMR">Early Childhood Mortality Rate (ECMR)</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The early childhood mortality rate (ECMR) is the number of children who died between their first and fifth birthdays, out of every 1,000 children in that age group (age 1 to 4 years inclusive). </p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The graph of the national ECMR shows annual rates, calculating by dividing the number of deaths given in the Registrar General's reports divided by the estimated population (derived from censuses). However the numbers of deaths to children aged one to four years are not provided for Registration Sub-Districts in any of the Registrar General's reports, so we have estimated the ECMRs for the five years leading up to each census using a statistical model which relates ECMR to infant mortality, industrial structure, and other variables capturing the disease environment and socio-economic conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Unlike the infant mortality rate (IMR), the early childhood mortality rate (ECMR) - along with mortality in older childhood and adulthood - declined more or less constantly from the 1870s onwards. This decline was mainly due to decreasing death rates from a variety of childhood infectious diseases, including scarlet fever, whooping cough and diarrhoea. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/ecmr1.png" alt="Early Childhood Mortality Rate" width="492" height="320" /> </p>
<p>As with infant mortality rates, there were large differences in early childhood mortality rates by type of place, with the lowest risks of death in agricultural areas, followed by professional places, and considerably higher risks in the urban industrial heartlands. Mining and textile areas, although they did not have the highest early childhood mortality, show up strongly in the maps as having high rates because they are geographically concentrated. In general the differences between places reduced as mortality fell, but mining areas failed to benefit as much as other types of places did from the improvements in child health over this period. </p>

<h3 class="SC1 SC2 SC3 SC4 SC5 SC6 SC7 SC8">Social Class</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: The social class variables given here provide the number of men aged 15-64 years in each social class expressed as a percentage of all men aged 15-64 years. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The social class classification used here was designed by the Registrar General of England and Wales in 1911. It is based on occupation, and allocates each occupational title to one of five social classes, while also singling out three groups of occupations for special treatment. These three special groups are not included in the five social classes. The five social classes are: I: professional and managerial (eg doctor, lawyer, accountant); II: Skilled non-manual/intermediate (eg farmer, dealer); III: Skilled manual (eg plasterer, blacksmith, electrician); IV: Semi-skilled manual (eg machinist, postman, barman); V: Unskilled manual (eg labourer, watchman). The three special occupational groups are: VI: Textile workers; VII: Miners; and VIII: Agricultural labourers.</p>
<p>Note that the scales on the maps for each class are different. </p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Industrial and occupational change over this period is evident in the increasing proportion of men who can be designated as belonging to the highest social class (social class I). However there was also a rise in social class IV over time, and a growth in the proportion of men employed as miners. The largest decrease was in the proportion of men employed as agricultural labourers, and these workers decreased in absolute terms too: the number of agricultural labourers declined by about a third between 1851 and 1911. Agricultural mechanisation and increasing efficiency in farming meant that at least as much food was able to be produced with less and less labour, and men who would previously have been agricultural labourers found more lucrative work in the manufacturing and tertiary sectors. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/sc1.png" alt="Percentage of men in each social class" width="547" height="310" /></p>
<p>The different social classes were not evenly distributed across the different types of place. Unsurprisingly, textile workers were concentrated in textile districts, miners in mining districts, and agricultural labourers in agricultural districts. Professional and Semi-Professional places had significantly higher proportions of men allocated to Social Class I, although this proportion was not increasing as fast as in other types of place. Along with mining areas, other urban areas had low proportions of the highest social classes, but the highest proportions of social class V, the lowest and least skilled class, were found in transport areas which were characterised by insecure manual work loading, un-loading and guarding goods. </p>

<h3 class="FMAR_PRATE">Married women working</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> This variable shows the number of married women aged 15 or over recorded as having an occupation (other than housewife or household duties) as a percentage of all married women aged 15 or over. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The proportion of married women working has been calculated using the marital status, age and occupation fields in the individual level census returns. </p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Nationwide the propensity of married women to record an occupation on census night halved between 1851 (20 per cent) and 1901 (9 per cent), with the biggest drop was recorded between the 1881 and 1891 censuses. To some extent changes in this variable may be affected by the way that the occupation question was asked in the different censuses, and particular instructions which were given regarding married women. For example between 1851 and 1881 respondents were instructed that the female relatives of farmers or lodging house keepers were to be recorded as occupied, as 'farmer's wife' or 'lodging house keeper's wife'. This instruction was dropped in 1891 and this might contribute to the sudden fall in married women's work in this year.   </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/fmar_prate1.png" alt="Percentage of married women occupied" width="473" height="318" /></p>
<p>However inspection of the maps shows that married women's work was highly spatially concentrated, and not limited to areas with significant numbers of farmers' and lodging house keepers' wives. Between the 1850s and 1880s there were significant employment opportunities for married women in textile manufacture in Lancashire and West Yorkshire; the straw plaiting industry in Bedfordshire and Essex; glove making and other sewing in Worcestershire; pottery in Stoke on Trent; and lace-making in Devon and in Nottinghamshire/Leicestershire. By the end of the century these enclaves had either disappeared or considerably shrunk. </p>
<p>This picture of shrinking work opportunities for married women is confirmed by the graph of percentages of married women working in the different types of place. Opportunities for paid work for married women were always considerably higher in textile areas, and lowest in mining areas, but they reduced everywhere over this period. </p>
<p>The contraction in employment opportunities for married women has been attributed to the rise of the 'male breadwinner ethic' and the 'cult of domesticity' which identified the home as the proper place for a married woman. Within this culture, paid work in most areas became restricted to only the poorest and most desperate of married women.</p>

<h3 class="FNM_PRATE">Single women working</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> This variable shows the number of single women aged 15 or over recorded as having an occupation (other than housewife or household duties) as a percentage of all single women aged 15 or over. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The proportion of single women working has been calculated using the marital status, age and occupation fields in the individual level census returns. </p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Around 70 per cent of single women were recorded as having an occupation in each census between 1851 and 1911. However this disguises considerable regional variation. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/fnm_prate1.png" alt="Percentage of single women occupied" width="473" height="318" /></p>
<p>Single women were employed in a wide range of occupations in nineteenth century England and Wales, from factory work, the pottery industry, agriculture, food and drink manufacture, retail, needlework, and other petty trades. By far the largest employment opportunity for single women, however, was the service industry, which accounted for around 50 per cent of single women's work in 1851, but declines in this sector mean that only 40 per cent of single women were employed in the sector in 1911. Although there were opportunities to work in domestic service across the country, these were more plentiful where wealthier people were concentrated, such as the west end of London and in the home counties. The textile industry was the second largest employer of young women, and this work was concentrated in the cotton manufacturing areas of Lancashire and West Yorkshire. </p>
<p>The regional nature of some employment opportunities for young women shows up in the graph of the percentages of single women occupied in each type of place (below). In textile areas the strong demand for young women to work in the cotton and woollen mills led to an employment rate of between 80 and 90 per cent of single women. In contrast there were fewer jobs available in mining areas, where not much more than half of all single women were able to find work. </p>

<h3 class="FWID_PRATE">Widowed women working</h3>
<p><strong>Definition: </strong>This variable shows the number of widowed women aged 15 or over recorded as having an occupation (other than housewife or household duties) as a percentage of all widowed women aged 15 or over. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The proportion of widowed women working has been calculated using the marital status, age and occupation fields in the individual level census returns. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/fwid_prate1.png" alt="Percentage of widowed women occupied" width="473" height="318" /></p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> In an era before state pensions, widowhood came with a significant risk of poverty, and this forced many widows to seek paid employment. Around half of all widows were recorded as having an occupation between 1851 and 1881, but this fell to around 40 per cent in 1891. In the beginning of the period a significant number of widows were able to find work in the textile and straw plaiting areas, producing some regional patterning of the likelihood of widows to be working. However this appears to have declined over the course of the half century, and by 1911 there was little geographic pattern to widows' work (with the exception of continued low levels of opportunity in mining areas). With this contraction in the sort of work open to widows, they were left predominantly doing laundry work, charring (cleaning), shop work and sewing.</p>

<h3 class="POP_DENS">Population density</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Population density is the number of people per acre (one acre is 4047m<sup>2</sup>). </p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> Population density has been calculated using the number of people enumerated in each RSD on census night as published in the census report for each census year, and the area of the RSD derived from the GIS of RSD boundaries.</p>
<p>Please note that the population density categories shown on the maps are not all the same size.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Towns and cities are generally more densely populated than rural areas, so the maps of this measure can be used to indicate the location of urban areas in England and Wales. Within urban areas, however, there was considerable variation in population density. Zooming in on London, for example, shows that the East End was much more densely populated than the West End where the wealthier people tended to live in larger more spaced out housing, and that the suburbs were generally less densely populated than the inner cities. Mining areas tended to be relatively sparsely populated as they were often comprised of collections of pit villages rather than towns or cities. NB People living in a Registration Sub-District (RSD) which encompassed both urban and rural areas were more likely to have lived in the urban part than the rural part, but the reported population density is calculated as an average for the whole unit.</p>
<p><img src="/images/about/pop_dens1.png" alt="Population density" width="479" height="287" /></p>
<p>Because the population of Britain was increasing rapidly between 1851 and 1911, population density was also increasing, from 0.48 to 0.97 persons per acre. However the additional people were not spread evenly across England and Wales as population increase was accompanied by rapid urbanisation. However the graphs of population density (below - note that it is shown on a log scale) and the area covered by the different types of place (see Type of Place variable) show although mining and textile places were increasing in population density, there were larger increases in the area covered by urban areas of various types. The growth of new urban and suburban areas seems to have been a more important part of urbanisation in the late nineteenth century than was the crowding of more people into existing towns and cities.  </p>

<h3 class="HOUSE_SERV">Houses with a live-in servant</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> This variable measures the percentage of households which had at least one live-in servant (excluding those specifically designated as farm servants).</p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The variable is calculated by classing each household where there was at least one person whose relationship to the head of household was given as 'servant', as a servant-keeping household. The number of servant-keeping households is then divided by the total number of households.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> During the pre-industrial and industrialising periods of British history, it was very common for young women to spend a period of time as a live-in servant in another family's household. This usually occurred between the late teens and mid-twenties, and allowed women (as well as men) to save up the money which would allow them to set up an independent household on marriage. This institution of domestic service was in decline, however from at least the mid-nineteenth century. In England and Wales as a whole the percentage of households which had at least one live-in servant declined from about 16 per cent in 1851 to about 9 per cent in 1911. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/house_serv1.png" alt="Percentage of houses with live-in servants" width="473" height="318" /></p>
<p>Only the better-off sections of society, of course, could afford to keep a live-in servant purely to look after the household, although many farming households also employed domestic servants whose duties probably combined household and agricultural work. Therefore the maps show servant keeping to be high in the hill-farming regions of Wales and the North. Otherwise relatively high levels of live-in servant keeping can be seen in the suburbanising ring around London, but these 'professional' places, although they had far higher levels of servant-keeping in each year, also witnessed the fastest decline in the practice. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/house_serv2.png" alt="Percentage of households with live-in servants" width="587" height="369" /></p>
<p>It should be remembered that this variables only measures live-in domestic service. Other sections of the middle classes may well have employed a servant who lived elsewhere and came in each day, or when needed. </p>

<h3 class="M_SMAM F_SMAM">Singulate Mean Age at Marriage (SMAM)</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The Singulate Mean Age at Marriage (SMAM) is a measure of the average age at which men or women married. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation:</strong> The SMAM is the average number of person-years lived in a single (never-married) state among those who marry before age 50. It is calculated from the proportions of men or women single at each age. It is therefore not a direct measure of the age at which the men or women in the population actually got married, but will be close to that if marriage patterns were not subject to rapid change, and in the absence of migratory movements which may swell or deplete the ranks of unmarried people without them contributing to the marriage market.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> The age at marriage has been relatively late for men and women in England and Wales since medieval times. In 1851 English and Welsh men got married at age 26.5 on average, with women marrying about a year younger. After a slight fall between 1851 and 1861, the age at marriage for both men and women increased, and slightly diverged, so that in 1911 men married at age 27.5 on average and women married just over age 26. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/smam1.png" alt="Singulate Mean Age at Marriage" width="472" height="342" /></p>
<p>There were considerable differences in age at marriage in places dominated by different economic structures, particularly among women, although increases in marriage age were witnessed everywhere. Marriage age was lowest in mining areas and for men there were pockets of particularly high age at marriage in the upland areas of Wales and the North.</p>
<p>Comparing the male and female SMAMs for different types of place suggests that women in professional areas married at even older ages than men in professional areas between 1861 and 1901. However this is predominantly an artefact of the way SMAMs are calculated: the influx of single young women into professional areas to work as domestic servants increases the number of person years lived while single and increases the SMAM. The majority of these young women do not stay in these areas and move elsewhere when they marry. There is no corresponding influx of young single men to increase the male SMAM in these areas.</p>
<p>The late age at marriage in England and Wales was one reason for moderate fertility before the demographic transition: the later marriage occurs the smaller is the proportion of the reproductive years which can be spent having children. </p>

<h3 class="M_CEL_4554 F_CEL_4554">Celibacy</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: This variable provides the number of men or women aged 45-54 who were single (never married) as a percentage of all men or women aged 45-54. Because few people marry for the first time after the age of 50, this represents the percentage of the population who never marry. </p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: The variable uses the marital status and age information in the individual level census returns, and is calculated separately for men and women.</p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: Between 1851 and 1891 around 10 per cent of men and 12 per cent of women remained unmarried at the end of their reproductive lives. Towards the end of the century this started to increase, reaching 12 and 16 per cent respectively. Although there were differences in the proportions of men remaining unmarried by type of place, with higher rates in Wales and the North, these were small compared to the differences in proportions of women. Among women, it was most uncommon to remain unmarried in mining areas throughout the period, while in professional areas between 20 and 30 per cent of women aged 45-54 never married. These differences are at least partly connected to labour market opportunities and migration among single women. There were few opportunities for single women to work in mining areas, and therefore little incentive for unmarried women to move to or stay in such areas. In contrast jobs open to single women were more plentiful in professional areas, leading to high levels of female in-migration and an excess of women in such places.</p>

<h3 class="TYPE">Type of place</h3>
<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Each geographic unit (Registration Sub-District) has been assigned to one of eight types of place based on its occupational structure and population density. The types of place are: Agriculture, Semi-Rural, Semi-Professional, Professional, Textile, Mining, Transport, and Other Urban.</p>
<p><strong>Calculation</strong>: For each RSD, the percentage of the economically active population (of both men and women) aged between 15 and 64 in each of the following occupational orders (excluding general labourers) was calculated: mining, metal work/manufacture, textiles, agriculture, pottery, professions, services, and transport. These percentages were then used to allocate each place as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If &gt;= 25% work in textiles then the place is TEXTILE</li>
	<li>Otherwise if &gt;=30% worked in mining or metals then the place is MINING</li>
	<li>Otherwise if &gt;=7.5% in professions AND &gt;=30% in services then the place is PROFESSIONAL</li>
	<li>Otherwise if &gt;=5% worked in agriculture AND population density &lt;1 then the place is AGRICULTURE</li>
	<li>Otherwise if &gt;=5% worked in agriculture then the place is SEMI-RURAL</li>
	<li>Otherwise if &gt;=15% in transport then the place is TRANSPORT</li>
	<li>Otherwise if &gt;=7.5% in professions then the place is SEMI-PROFESSIONAL</li>
	<li>Otherwise the place is OTHER URBAN</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise was carried out separately for each year, allowing places to change character through economic development. </p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>: In terms of area, both England and Wales were still predominantly agricultural in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. However agricultural areas were sparsely populated; the bulk of the population already lived in towns and cities. In the years leading up to the dawn of the twentieth century the process of urbanisation continued, so that by 1901 over 80 per cent of the population of England and Wales lived in urban areas.  Urban growth took place by three different processes: natural increase (an excess of births over deaths) in urban areas, migration of rural-dwellers to towns and cities, and extensive growth (or building) turning areas of countryside into town. The maps, and the graph of the number of acres covered by different types of place, show the latter process clearly, with the gradual increase in the non-green colours, indicating the change in the character of areas. This is particularly noticeable in the area around London with the growth of professional and semi-professional areas radiating out from the city. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/type1.png" alt="Number of acres covered by different types of place" width="584" height="367" /></p>
<p>The growth of professional places is particularly noticeable on the map, but it was the semi-professional places which saw the largest increase in population. There was a decline of 1.2 million people living in agricultural areas between 1851 and 1911, but because the population almost doubled over this period, the percentage of the population living in agricultural areas fell from 45 to 20 per cent. </p>
<p><img src="/images/about/type2.png" alt="Number of people living in types of place" width="584" height="367" /></p>
<p>Examination of the maps shows that some of the types of area were very geographically concentrated, notably textile and mining areas. Others, such as transport and other urban were spread around the country and are harder to identify on the maps. </p>
