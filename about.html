<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The second half of the nineteenth century was a period of major change in the dynamics of the British population. This was a time of transformation from a relatively 'high pressure' demographic regime characterised by medium to high birth and death rates to a 'low pressure' regime of low birth and death rates, a transformation known as the 'demographic transition'. This transition was not uniform across the England and Wales: certain places and social groups led the declines and others lagged behind. Exploring these geographical patterns can provide insights into the process of change and the influence of economic and geographical factors.</p>
<p>This website allows users to create and view custom maps of different measures of both fertility and other socio-demographic measures related to fertility every 10 years between 1851 and 1911. The additional measures include child mortality, marriage, migration status, occupational status and population density. Brief explanations are included of each measure, including how they are calculated and how they relate to other measures. Users can zoom in to a particular area on the map, and compare side by side maps of different times or measures. The geographic units used in the maps are Registration Sub-Districts (RSDs).</p>
<h3 id="Heading5">Geographic units</h3>
<p>The geographical units used in these maps are Registration Sub-Districts (RSDs). These were units used for reporting both census outputs and vital statistics between 1851 and 1911. There were about 2,000 RSDs in each year, ranging in area from xxxx to xxxx acres, and in population size from yyyy to yyyy. RSDs which were predominantly urban tended to be smaller and often more populous, therefore with higher population density than those in rural areas. However not all RSDs covered a uniformly urban or uniformly rural area: some RSDs covered a portion of a town and some of the surrounding area, and those in the countryside included rural settlements of varying sizes. While many RSDs stayed covered largely the same areas in different years, there was a considerable amount of re-drawing of the boundaries over time. Therefore there is a different number of RSDs at each point in time, and there was a particularly large amount of change between 1891 and 1901, when many urban RSDs were merged into larger units.</p>
<p>Boundary data: These maps use one boundary data set with a larger number of units than there are RSDs, as any geographical area which belongs in different RSDs in different years has a separate shape. In each year an RSD is made up of one of more of these constituent areas. Where an RSD is made up of more than one area, all of the constituent areas of that RSD are given the same value of the measures shown. Boundary data files consisting of one shape for each RSD are also available for each year. OR: Due to boundary changes, a different boundary data set is used for each year. Please contact XXXXX if you would like to use these boundary data sets.</p>

<h3 id="Heading13">Population density</h3>
<p>Population density is the number of people per acre (one acre is 4047m<sup>2</sup>). Towns and cities are generally more densely populated than rural areas, so the maps of this measure can be used to indicate the location of urban areas in England and Wales. Within urban areas, however, there was considerable variation in population density. Zooming in on London, for example, shows that the East End was much more densely populated than the West End where the wealthier people tended to live in larger more spaced out housing, and that the suburbs were generally less densely populated than the inner cities. NB People living in a Registration Sub-District (RSD) which encompassed both urban and rural areas were more likely to have lived in the urban part than the rural part, but the reported population density is calculated as an average for the whole unit.</p>
<p>Population density has been calculated using the number of people enumerated in each RSD on census night as published in the census report for each census year, and the area of the RSD derived from the GIS of RSD boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="Heading16">Measuring fertility</h3>
<p>The easiest measure of fertility to calculate is the Crude Birth Rate (CBR) which is the number of births in a year, per 1,000 people alive in the middle of that year. The CBR in England and Wales fell dramatically over the last few decades of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century, decreasing from around 35 births per 1,000 people in the 1860s and 1870s to 15 births per 1,000 people in the early 1930s. However the CBR is a very poor measure of child-bearing experience. In the first place it is often distorted by changes in mortality and the age-structure of the population, a particularly pertinent issue in the late nineteenth century when mortality was also in rapid decline. For example if there are fewer women in the childbearing ages, then the CBR will be lower, even if each woman is having the same number of children. Secondly it tells us nothing about the way that family-building patterns changed by women's age. In particular it does not tell us whether fewer children were born because women delayed the start of their child-bearing career, began to have larger gaps between their children, or stopped having children at a younger age. These sorts of questions can only be answered using data which give the age of the mother at the time of the child's birth, and until recently such data has not been available for this crucial period of Britain's demographic history.</p>
<p>This project uses an alternative set of fertility measures:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Total Fertility Rate: the average number of children per woman, irrespective of marital status.</li>
	<li>Total Marital Fertility Rate: the average number of children per married woman.</li>
	<li>Legitimate Fertility Rate: the number of legitimate births divided by the number of married women in the childbearing ages.</li>
	<li>Illegitimate Fertility Rate: the number of illegitimate births divided by the number of unmarried women in the childbearing ages.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="TFR">Total Fertility Rate (TFR)</h3>
<p>The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) can be interpreted as the average number of children a women has over her life-time. In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, women in England and Wales had around four and a half children each, although there was considerable geographic variation, with considerably higher fertility in the mining areas of the North-East, and particularly low fertility in the West End of London. By 1911 the TFR had fallen by a third, and women were having only three children each. It is important to bear in mind that many women remained unmarried and without any children at all, and this reduces the average number of children. The average number of children among married women is higher, and is given by a related measure, the Total Marital Fertility Rate (TMFR).</p>
<p>There are no sources which record how many children women had over their lifetime in this historical period, so the TFR is calculated by assuming that each woman successively experienced the birth-rates of women at each age group.  The birth rates of women in each age group are called Age-Specific Fertility Rates (ASFRs) and can be calculated from the census by identifying children and their mothers and working out how many children were born to women of each age group in the five years leading up the census, and adjusting for various factors including child mortality and children living away from their mothers.</p>
<p>ASFRs and TFRs are calculated using a database of the individual level census enumerators' books for each census year originally made available by the <a href="http://icem.data-archive.ac.uk/">I-CeM project</a> and further enhanced by the Atlas of Fertility project team (REF).</p>

<h3 id="IMR">Infant mortality rate (IMR)</h3>
<p>The infant mortality rate is the number children who died before they were a year old out of each 1,000 children born. The IMR was around 150 per thousand for England and Wales as a whole across the second half of the ninteteenth century. Unlike mortality at older ages of childhood and in adulthood which began to decline from about 1870, the national rate did not start to decline until the turn of the century. However there was considerable geographic variation in rates of infant mortality across England and Wales, with rates ranging from xxxx in the rural area of yyyy in date, to zzzz in the city of kkkk in date. Higher urban infant mortality has been attributed to crowded populations living in crowded and insanitary conditions, favouring the spread of infectious diseases. Infant mortality was also particularly high in the urban-industrial areas of Lancashire and Yorkshire and in the coal mining pit villages of South Wales and the North-East.</p>
<p>There are strong theoretical reasons why infant mortality and fertility might be linked. Traditional demographic transition theory suggests that fertility remained high until after infant mortality had begun to fall because parents needed to give birth to more than the number of children they actually wanted in order to ensure that enough survived beyond infancy. It is clear from the trajectories of fertility and infant mortality in England and Wales that infant mortality did not decline first. It is also clear from the geographies of infant mortality and fertility that while high infant mortality and high fertility often co-existed, this was not necessarily the case. For example mining areas had both high infant mortality and high fertility and middle class areas had low levels of both, but textile areas had high infant mortality and low fertility, while agricultural areas had high fertility but low infant mortality. The relationship between infant mortality and fertility is therefore complex and contingent on local circumstances, disease environments and domestic practices.</p>
<p>Infant mortality is important in itself, but it is also crucial to our calculations of fertility. Because fertility is calculated from children who survive to be enumerated in the census, it does not include children who were born in the five years leading up to the census but who died before census date. The infant mortality rates in each RSD are therefore used to inflate the number of children of each age to account for children who died.</p>
<p>Here we show IMRs calculated for the five years leading up to each census to minimise the fluctuations due to small numbers in some areas. To calculate the IMR, we divide all deaths to infants (i.e. children under a year old) in the five years leading up to each census (e.g. April 1876 to March 1881 for the five years leading up to the 1881 census), by the number of children born in the same period, and multiply by 1,000. Some of the deaths to infants dying in the early part of the period (e.g. in April 1876) will have been to infants born previously (e.g. in February 1876), but this is compensated for by deaths born towards the end of the period e.g. in March 1881) and dying afterwards (e.g. in May 1881). This is the usual method for calculating the infant mortality rate. The data on infant births and deaths were obtained from the Registrar General's Quarterly Returns of Births, Deaths and Marriages.</p>
