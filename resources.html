<h2>National RSD maps</h2>

<p>The <a href="/">online map</a> allows users to look at maps showing a variety variables for the whole of England and Wales at the Registration District level and then to zoom into see the values of the same variables for their choice of Registration Sub-Districts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately browser speed constraints mean that it is not possible, even in full screen mode, to see the 'national picture' made up of all the Registration Sub-Districts in this interactive mode.</p>
<p>Here we provide suites of 'static' maps showing the values of selected variables at the Registration Sub-District level at each available census year for the whole of England and Wales.</p>
<p>The maps may be used to compare 'local' details to 'the national picture'.</p>
<p>These maps may be reproduced as long as they retain the copyright reference.</p>
<p>Please note that the boundaries shown are for Registration Counties, Registration Sub-District boundaries have not been reproduced for the sake of clarity.</p>
